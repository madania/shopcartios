# SDK Folder
Download the SDK from the [SAP Store](https://store.sap.com/sap/cpa/ui/resources/store/html/SolutionDetails.html?pid=0000014485). You will need at least the SDK 1.0 **SP02**. 

Extract the SDK and open the **Frameworks** folder. 

If you want to test in the simulator and on a real device then open the the folder **Release-fat**. If you only test in the simulator then open the **Release-iphonesimulator** folder. If you only want to test on a real device then open the **Release-iphoneos** folder.

Copy the following framework files into this folder:

* SAPCommon.framework
* SAPFoundation.framework
* SAPFiori.framework
* SAPOData.framework
